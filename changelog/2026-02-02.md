> Note: This entry reflects planning notes from that date and may not match the current code state.

## Summary

Initial documentation setup and comprehensive planning for Aurum Labs prediction market platform.

## Actions Completed

### Repository Access Verified
- ✅ aurum-contracts - Accessible via SSH
- ✅ aurum-app - Accessible via SSH
- ✅ aurum-backend - Accessible via SSH
- ✅ aurum-website - Accessible via SSH
- ✅ aurum-docs - Accessible via SSH

### Wallet Verification
- **Address**: `0x095b95ea2ad7e05c4c7104f1f0743dc046a108b6`
- **Network**: Base Sepolia
- **Balance**: 1.0 ETH (sufficient for deployment)
- **Status**: Ready for testnet deployment

### Research Completed

#### Polymarket Analysis
- Uses CLOB (Central Limit Order Book) for trading
- UMA Oracle for market resolution
- 2-hour challenge period for all markets
- USDC as collateral on Polygon

#### UMA Oracle Research
- Optimistic oracle design
- Proposer stakes tokens to propose outcomes
- Disputers can challenge within liveness period
- DVM (Data Verification Mechanism) for disputed outcomes
- 48-96 hour voting period

#### Tokenomics Research
- Analyzed UMA, AAVE, Compound distributions
- Recommended distribution for AURUM token
- Vesting schedules defined

### Documentation Created

| Document | Path | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| README | `/README.md` | Main documentation index |
| Architecture Overview | `/architecture/overview.md` | High-level system design |
| Smart Contracts | `/architecture/smart-contracts.md` | Contract specifications |
| Oracle System | `/architecture/oracle-system.md` | Aurum Oracle design |
| Tokenomics | `/tokenomics/aurum-token.md` | AURUM token economics |
| Roadmap | `/development/roadmap.md` | Development timeline |

### Key Decisions Made

1. **Collateral Token**: USDC on Base
2. **Challenge Period**: 
   - Binary markets: 2 hours (same as Polymarket)
   - Categorical markets: 24 hours (more time for complex outcomes)
3. **Minimum Stake**: 100 AURUM
4. **Liquidity Model**: AMM for MVP (simpler), CLOB for future
5. **Fee Structure**: 2% redemption fee

### Token Distribution Finalized

| Allocation | Percentage |
|------------|------------|
| Treasury | 40% |
| Community & Ecosystem | 25% |
| Team & Advisors | 15% |
| Investors | 10% |
| Initial Liquidity | 5% |
| Airdrop | 5% |

## Next Steps

1. Create GitHub issues on all repositories
2. Begin smart contract development
3. Set up aurum-app project
4. Set up aurum-backend project

## Notes

- Existing ConditionalTokens.sol in aurum-contracts uses ERC6909 (good)
- Need to implement: AurumToken, AurumOracle, MarketFactory, MarketAMM, FeeCollector
- Frontend will use React + Vite + Tailwind + wagmi
- Backend will use Node.js + TypeScript + PostgreSQL
