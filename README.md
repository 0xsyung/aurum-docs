# Aurum Labs Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation repository for **Aurum Labs** - a decentralized prediction market platform built on Base.

## Overview

Aurum Labs is building a prediction market platform similar to Polymarket, but with our own governance token (AURUM) and oracle system. The platform allows users to trade on the outcomes of future events using outcome tokens backed by stablecoin collateral.
